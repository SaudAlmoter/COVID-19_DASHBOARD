# Developing a Dashboard for Visualizing COVID-19 Vaccination Data

## Introduction
Data analysis and visualization is an important tool in various areas, including engineering, science, medicine, economics, finance and decision making in general. Due to the large amount of data generated everyday, using efficient
data structure to store and manipulate data is critical for the successful development of data analysis and visualization applications. Your goal in this assignment is to develop and use such data structures for the manipulation and
visualization of data on the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaign.

## The Dashboard
The goal of this assignment is to develop a dashboard for displaying the progress of vaccination in a specified country
(see Figure 1 for the case of Italy).
